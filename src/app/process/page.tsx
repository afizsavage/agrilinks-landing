          Agrilinks collects price information from regional markets on a daily basis.
          Our enumerators are collecting this information for bulk and retail sales for
          more than 20 produces across Sierra Leone and uploading them on the platform.
        </p>
        <p>
          Users can access the average prices per crop per district to help them price
          their own goods or decide on the most profitable market opportunity.
          These prices are communicated in local units of measurement
          (bag, cup, pan, tie, etc.) and in metric unit (price per kilo or liter).

      <p>
        A user requesting the average price for corn seeds for Kono district will
        receive the average price for a bag of corn seeds (with the conversion in kilo)
